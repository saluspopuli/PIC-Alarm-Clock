* 4 digit 7 segment display for current time (24-hr format)
	- Create library for PIC to handle the 7seg 4 digit LED display

* Real-time display in 24-hr format that persists through shutdowns using RTC module

* Store alarm times in EEPROM so it persists through shutdowns

* Can send commands to the PIC via Bluetooth UART 
	- Commands include:
		- Adding alarm times (max 10 maybe?)
		- Displaying all current alarm times on the 7seg (2 sec between each)

* Button to shut off alarm
	- If no alarm maybe I could make it cycle between time, day & month, and year
